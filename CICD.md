# CI/CD 
## Introduction

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment. It is a set of practices that aims to automate the building, testing and deployment of software applications. CI/CD is the backbone of a DevOps methodology, bringing developers and IT operations teams together to deploy software. Continuous Integration refers to the process of automatically building, testing, and integrating code changes into a shared repository. Continuous Delivery refers to making code changes available for release (e.g. by uploading the application to a container registry). Continuous Deployment refers to automatically releasing code changes to production.
